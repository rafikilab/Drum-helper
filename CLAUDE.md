# CRITICAL COST-SAVING RESTRICTIONS
⚠️ NEVER CREATE FILES UNLESS EXPLICITLY REQUESTED ⚠️
- NEVER create supplementary files unless user explicitly asks for them
- NEVER create supporting materials (examples, templates, references) unless requested
- NEVER create additional documentation beyond what's specifically asked
- NEVER create configuration or setup files unless explicitly requested
- ONLY create new files when the task cannot be accomplished by editing existing ones
- Focus ONLY on the user's specific request - do not add extras
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- If user wants additional materials, examples, or documentation - they will explicitly ask for them
